{"name":"Small Cloud Backup","tagline":"","body":"### Small Cloud Backup\r\nWhen we choose to use cloud services to support our new web application we choose the best ones that fit specific purpose. Which source control provider? Which cloud storage? Which CRM? Which project management tool?\r\n\r\nAnd as we choose the best our own application and our business starts to *depend* on them.\r\n\r\nNow each and every cloud service can have its own protection from various disasters. And it starts to spread.\r\n\r\nSCB is an answer to a cloud application backup. \r\n\r\n### Design\r\nSCB is in itself a cloud application as well. It is designed to be run on Heroku but can also be run on other aaS as well as on your own dedicated servers.\r\n\r\nIt provides three main components:\r\n* The **backuper** that can connect to specific services and fetch data, prepare the backups and store it somewhere,\r\n* The **scheduler** that can queue the backup tasks,\r\n* The **config** - a configuration application.\r\n\r\nBy design you own the instance of this application. You can deploy a copy of it on Heroku and it will be private to you. No data will (or, for that matter, can) be shared between two instances of SCB.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
